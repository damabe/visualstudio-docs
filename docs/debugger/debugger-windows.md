# Inspect data using debugger windows in Visual Studio

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

You can open most debugger windows while you're debugging your program. To see a list of debugger windows, set a breakpoint and start debugging. When you hit the breakpoint and execution stops, choose **Debug > Windows**.
