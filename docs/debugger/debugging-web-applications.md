# Debugging Web Applications

 [!INCLUDE [Visual Studio](~/includes/applies-to-version/vs-windows-only.md)]

This article provides links to help you debug different types of web applications.

- Debug ASP.NET applications

  For steps that are required to enable debugging of ASP.NET applications, see [Debug ASP.NET applications](how-to-enable-debugging-for-aspnet-applications.md).

- Debug client-side script in ASP.NET

  For required steps, see the blog post [Debug JavaScript in Microsoft Edge](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debug-javascript-in-microsoft-edge-from-visual-studio/) and this [post for Google Chrome](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/client-side-debugging-of-asp-net-projects-in-google-chrome).

- Debug JavaScript and TypeScript

  See [Debug JavaScript and TypeScript](../javascript/debug-nodejs.md).

- View script documents

  You can see lists of server-side and client-side script documents in the **Solution Explorer** to view. You can open any script document from **Solution Explorer**. For more information, see [How to: View Script Documents](../debugger/how-to-view-script-documents.md).

- Debugging AJAX Script Applications

  AJAX-enabled Web applications make heavy use of script code and pose special debugging challenges. For information about AJAX debugging techniques, see [Debugging and Tracing Ajax Applications Overview](/previous-versions/bb398817(v=vs.140)).
